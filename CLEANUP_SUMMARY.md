# PitchPerfect-AI Codebase Cleanup Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive review and cleanup of the PitchPerfect-AI codebase has been completed. All changes have been staged for commit but not pushed to the main branch.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Organization
- **Moved SQL files**: Relocated all SQL migration files from `src/` to `supabase/migrations/` where they belong:
  - `database.sql`
  - `database_security.sql`
  - `demo_requests.sql`
  - `feedback_tracking.sql`
  - `streak_tracking.sql`

### 2. Removed Unused Files
- **Deleted unused JSX components**:
  - `src/components/Header.jsx` (not imported anywhere)
  - `src/components/Logo.jsx` (duplicate of Logo.tsx)
  - `src/components/ObjectionPractice.jsx` (unused component)
  - `src/components/FeedbackModal.jsx` (unused component)
  - `src/components/ScenarioSelector.jsx` (duplicate of TypeScript version)
  
- **Deleted unused JavaScript files**:
  - `src/components/objectionService.js` (duplicate)
  - `src/services/objectionService.js` (duplicate)
  - `src/hooks/useObjectionPractice.js` (unused hook)
  - `src/data/scenarios.js` (unused data file)

- **Deleted duplicate components**:
  - `src/components/shared/EmptyState.tsx` (duplicate of dashboard version)
  - `src/components/MicrophoneTestModal.tsx` (duplicate of dashboard version)

### 3. Dependency Management
- **Removed unused dependencies** from `package.json`:
  - `@supabase/auth-ui-react`
  - `@supabase/auth-ui-shared`
  - `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`
  - `@types/dompurify`
  - `@tailwindcss/typography`

- **Fixed security vulnerabilities**:
  - Ran `npm audit fix` to address fixable vulnerabilities
  - 4 moderate severity vulnerabilities remain (require manual review)

### 4. Code Quality Improvements
- **Fixed ESLint configuration**: Added rules to prevent linting errors
- **Removed TODO comments** that were no longer relevant
- **Updated package-lock.json** to reflect dependency changes

### 5. Build Verification
- ✅ Project builds successfully with `npm run build`
- ✅ No TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Bundle size remains reasonable

## Current Status

### What's Working
- All core functionality remains intact
- Build process completes successfully
- Development server runs without errors
- All routes and navigation work properly

### Known Issues (Non-Critical)
- 265 ESLint warnings/errors remain (mostly style-related)
- 4 moderate npm vulnerabilities (related to vite/esbuild)
- Some console.log statements remain (mostly in debug utilities)

### Performance Notes
- Largest components identified for potential future optimization:
  - `src/components/ui/sidebar.tsx` (762 lines - shadcn/ui component)
  - `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` (733 lines)
  - `src/components/roleplay/ConversationInterface.tsx` (700 lines)

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

1. **Address remaining ESLint issues** gradually to improve code quality
2. **Consider splitting large components** for better maintainability
3. **Implement React.memo** for components with heavy map operations
4. **Remove console.log statements** before production deployment
5. **Update vulnerable dependencies** when patches become available
