  '✓ Modified Login page to use saved routes for redirection',
  '✓ Added SessionRestorer component for page refresh handling',
  '✓ Updated sessionCleanup to preserve routing data',
  '✓ Integrated route persistence into App component',
  '✓ Added support for query parameters in routes',
  '✓ Set 24-hour expiration for saved routes',
  '✓ Set 30-minute expiration for intended routes'
