## Estimated Timeline

### Critical Fixes Only: 3-5 days
- Day 1: Security fixes & configuration
- Day 2-3: Core functionality (AI integration)
- Day 4: Payment & subscription fixes
- Day 5: Testing & validation

### Full Pre-Launch Prep: 2 weeks
- Week 1: All critical + high priority items
- Week 2: Testing, optimization, and polish

## Launch Go/No-Go Decision

### Current Status: ❌ NO GO

**Major Blockers:**
1. Mock AI implementation (users paying for fake features)
2. Hardcoded security credentials
3. Incomplete payment integration
4. Poor mobile experience
5. No error tracking

**Minimum Viable Launch Requirements:**
- ✅ Real AI functionality
- ✅ Secure configuration
- ✅ Working payments
- ✅ Mobile functional
- ✅ Basic monitoring

## Post-Launch Plan

### Day 1
- Monitor error rates
- Check payment processing
- Review user feedback
- Watch server performance

### Week 1
- Fix critical bugs
- Improve based on feedback
- Optimize performance
- Add missing features

### Month 1
- Implement advanced features
- Expand marketing
- Analyze user behavior
- Plan next iteration

## Final Recommendation

**DO NOT LAUNCH** until at least all critical items are resolved. The application is currently charging users for mock features, which could lead to refund requests and damage to reputation.

**Realistic Launch Date:** 2 weeks from now with focused effort on critical issues.

**Launch Confidence Score:** 45% (will be 85%+ after critical fixes)
