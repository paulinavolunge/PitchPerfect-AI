## Executive Summary
The application shows promise but has several UX issues that will frustrate users and cause abandonment. Key concerns include incomplete features, poor mobile optimization, and confusing user flows.

## Critical UX Issues

### 1. Onboarding Flow Problems
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** New users will struggle to understand the value proposition

**Issues:**
- No clear tutorial or walkthrough for first-time users

- After signup, users land on empty dashboard with no guidance

**Recommendations:**
- Add interactive onboarding tour
- Show sample analysis before requiring signup

### 2. Voice Recording Confusion
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** Core feature appears broken

**Issues:**
