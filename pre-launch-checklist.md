## 8. Infrastructure

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Found
- Port configuration mismatch between Vite (8080) and tests (5173)
- Missing system dependencies for Playwright
- Development mode detection working correctly

## Critical Action Items

1. **URGENT**: Fix port configuration mismatch in test suite
2. **URGENT**: Implement missing analytics integrations
3. **HIGH**: Add proper test data attributes to UI elements
4. **HIGH**: Configure error tracking with Sentry
5. **MEDIUM**: Install system dependencies for cross-browser testing
6. **MEDIUM**: Complete accessibility audit
7. **LOW**: Add comprehensive E2E test coverage

## Recommendation
**DO NOT LAUNCH** until critical issues are resolved. The application has good foundation but lacks essential monitoring, analytics, and has configuration issues that prevent proper testing.
