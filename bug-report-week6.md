# PitchPerfect AI - Bug Report (Week 6)
**Date:** December 26, 2024  
**Severity:** CRITICAL üî¥

## New Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. Test Infrastructure Failure üî¥
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Blocks all automated testing

**Description:**
- Playwright tests fail to run due to port configuration mismatch
- Vite dev server runs on port 8080, but tests expect 5173
- Tests timeout waiting for server on wrong port

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Run `npm run test:e2e`
2. Tests fail with timeout error

**Expected:** Tests should run against correct port  
**Actual:** Tests timeout after 120 seconds

**Fix Required:**
- Already updated playwright.config.ts to use port 8080
- Need to verify all test configurations

---

### 2. JavaScript Loading Failure üî¥
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Impact:** Application completely unusable

**Description:**
- Page displays "Loading JavaScript..." message indefinitely
- Main application fails to initialize
- Fallback suggests checking console for errors

**Evidence:**
- Test screenshots show only loading message
- No main content renders

**Potential Causes:**
- Build configuration issues
- Module loading problems
- Development server misconfiguration

---

### 3. Missing Analytics Integration üü†
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** No user behavior tracking

**Description:**
- PostHog integration not found despite being in requirements
- No analytics events being tracked
- User behavior data unavailable

**Search Results:**
- `grep -r "PostHog"` returns no results
- Analytics tracking functions exist but no provider

---

### 4. Missing Error Tracking üü†
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Production errors invisible

**Description:**
- Sentry integration not configured
- No error reporting mechanism
- User issues will go unnoticed

**Search Results:**
- `grep -r "Sentry"` returns no results
- Error boundaries exist but don't report errors

---

### 5. System Dependencies Missing üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Cross-browser testing limited

**Description:**
- Playwright system dependencies not installed
- Missing 40+ libraries for browser automation
- Warnings about unofficial OS support

**Error Message:**
```
Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers.
Missing libraries:
    libgstreamer-1.0.so.0
    libgtk-4.so.1
    ... (40+ more)
```

---

### 6. Test Data Attributes Missing üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Tests cannot find elements reliably

**Description:**
- Expected `data-onboarding="hero"` not found
- Test IDs inconsistent or missing
- Makes test automation brittle

**Example:**
- Test expects `[data-onboarding="hero"]`
- Actual element has `id="hero-heading"`

---

## Regression Check Results

### ‚úÖ No Regressions Found (Unable to fully verify due to test failures)
- Cannot confirm previous fixes still work
- Need working test suite to verify

### ‚ùì Unable to Verify
- Login/signup flows
- Voice features
- Feedback submission
- Guest mode
- Error boundaries
- Performance optimizations

## Summary

**Total New Issues:** 6
- Critical: 2
- High: 2  
- Medium: 2

**Blocking Launch:** YES

The discovery of critical infrastructure issues, particularly the JavaScript loading failure and missing monitoring tools, makes this application unsuitable for production launch. The inability to run automated tests means we cannot verify that any features work correctly or that previous fixes haven't introduced regressions.

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix JavaScript loading issue** - Application is completely broken
2. **Resolve test infrastructure** - Cannot verify any functionality
3. **Implement monitoring** - Add PostHog and Sentry immediately
4. **Install system dependencies** - Enable proper cross-browser testing
5. **Add test data attributes** - Make tests reliable
6. **Run full regression suite** - Once tests are working

**DO NOT DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION** until all critical issues are resolved.
