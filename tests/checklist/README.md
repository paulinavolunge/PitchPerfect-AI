## Testing Philosophy

### Be Thorough
- Test every feature multiple times
- Use different browsers and devices
- Try edge cases and invalid inputs
- Test under poor network conditions

### Be Critical
- Document every issue found
- No issue is too small
- Consider user impact
- Think about edge cases

### Be Detailed
- Screenshot all issues
- Record exact reproduction steps
- Note environment details
- Measure performance metrics

## Priority Focus Areas

Given early-stage startup with 3 users:

1. **Onboarding** - Must be flawless
2. **Core AI Features** - Must deliver value
3. **Payment Processing** - Must be reliable
4. **Mobile Experience** - Many users on mobile
5. **Performance** - Users won't wait

## Zero Defect Mindset

**Remember**: Sales professionals depend on this tool for their livelihood. Every bug could cost them a deal. Every performance issue could lose a customer. Every confusing flow could prevent skill improvement.

**Quality Bar**: Not "good enough" but "exceptional"
