```

### Run All Scenario Tests
```bash
# Run complete scenario test suite
./tests/scenarios/run-scenario-tests.sh
```

### Run Specific Test Categories

#### Sales Professional Scenarios
```bash
# All sales scenarios
npx playwright test tests/scenarios/sales-professional-scenarios.test.ts

# Specific user type
npx playwright test -g "New Sales Rep"
npx playwright test -g "Experienced Sales"
npx playwright test -g "Sales Manager"
```

#### Edge Cases & Stress Tests
```bash
# All edge cases
npx playwright test tests/scenarios/edge-cases-stress.test.ts

# Specific test categories
npx playwright test -g "High Usage"
npx playwright test -g "Error Handling"
npx playwright test -g "Browser & Device"
```

### Configuration Options

#### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run with performance metrics
npx playwright test --reporter=html --trace=on

# Run with video recording for debugging
npx playwright test --video=on --video-size=1280x720
```

#### Cross-Browser Testing
```bash
# Test on all browsers
npx playwright test --project=chromium --project=firefox --project=webkit

# Test on specific browser
npx playwright test --project=firefox
```

#### Device Emulation

# Test on mobile devices
npx playwright test --device="iPhone 13"
npx playwright test --device="Pixel 5"
```

## Test Reports

After running tests, you'll find:
- **HTML Report**: `scenario-test-results-*/playwright-report/index.html`
- **Summary Report**: `scenario-test-results-*/scenario-test-summary.md`
- **Coverage Matrix**: `scenario-test-results-*/test-coverage-matrix.txt`
- **Detailed Logs**: `scenario-test-results-*/[test-name].log`

## Performance Benchmarks

Expected test execution times:
- New Sales Rep Journey: ~45 seconds
- Experienced Sales Flow: ~38 seconds
- Team Management: ~52 seconds
- Stress Tests: ~2-3 minutes
- Full Suite: ~10-15 minutes

## Debugging Failed Tests

### Common Issues

1. **Timeout Errors**
   ```bash
   # Increase timeout for slow tests
   npx playwright test --timeout=60000
   ```

2. **Permission Errors**
   ```bash
   # Run with headed mode to manually grant permissions
   npx playwright test --headed
   ```

3. **Flaky Tests**
   ```bash
   # Run with retries
   npx playwright test --retries=2
   ```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run in debug mode
PWDEBUG=1 npx playwright test -g "test name"

# Run with inspector
npx playwright test --debug
```

## Best Practices

1. **Realistic Scenarios**: Tests mirror actual user behavior
2. **Data Isolation**: Each test uses unique test data
3. **Cleanup**: Tests clean up after themselves
4. **Assertions**: Multiple checkpoints throughout flows
5. **Error Recovery**: Tests verify error recovery paths

## Maintenance

- Update test data regularly
- Review and update scenarios quarterly
- Monitor test execution times
- Fix flaky tests immediately
- Keep Playwright updated

## Contributing

When adding new scenarios:
1. Follow existing test patterns
2. Include both happy path and error cases
3. Add appropriate waits and timeouts
4. Document new test scenarios
5. Update this README
