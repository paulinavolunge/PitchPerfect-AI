# Dashboard Route Fixes

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Supabase ERR_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES Errors** âœ…
- **Problem**: Repeated errors for `log_security_event` RPC and `user_profiles` queries
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Added throttling to SafeRPCService (1 second interval)
  - Implemented retry limits (max 3 retries)
  - Added exponential backoff for rate-limited requests
  - Created SQL migration for `log_security_event` function with error handling
  - Function now fails silently to prevent cascading failures
  - Added automatic cleanup of old events (30 days retention)

### 2. **Onboarding Modal Stuck on Step 2** âœ…
- **Problem**: Modal wouldn't progress past step 2 when clicking "Continue"
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Fixed state updates to use functional updates (`setCurrentStep(prev => prev + 1)`)
  - Fixed auto-advance logic to only run on step 0
  - Ensured modal properly closes on completion or ESC key
  - Added proper cleanup when modal closes
  - Fixed button layout and navigation flow

### 3. **Network Overload - 15000+ Requests** âœ…
- **Problem**: Infinite retry loops causing thousands of requests
- **Solutions Implemented**:
  - Throttled all RPC calls at 1-second intervals
  - Added request deduplication by key
  - Limited retries to 3 attempts max
  - Added retry counter reset after 1 minute
  - Prevented duplicate auth event logging
  - Reduced profile fetch retries from unlimited to 2

## ðŸ”§ Technical Improvements

### SafeRPCService Enhancements:
```typescript
// Throttling configuration
const THROTTLE_INTERVAL = 1000; // 1 second
const MAX_RETRIES = 3;
const RETRY_DELAY = 1000; // 1 second

// Prevents request spam
- Throttles calls by function + params
- Tracks retry counts per request
- Exponential backoff for rate limits
- Automatic retry reset after 1 minute
```

### AuthContext Optimizations:
- Removed excessive console logging
- Fixed auth event listener to prevent duplicate events
- Optimized profile loading with proper error handling
- Added rate limit detection and graceful fallback
- Reduced retry attempts to prevent spam

### Database Function:
- Created robust `log_security_event` function
- Handles all errors silently
- Auto-cleanup of old events
- Proper RLS policies
- Optimized indexes for performance

## ðŸ“Š Performance Improvements

### Before:
- 15,000+ network requests
- Console spam with errors
- UI freezing from request overload
- Stuck onboarding modal

### After:
- Throttled requests (max 1 per second per endpoint)
- Silent failure for non-critical operations
- Smooth UI performance
- Working onboarding flow

## âœ… Testing Checklist

- [x] No more console spam for security events
- [x] Onboarding modal progresses through all steps
- [x] Dashboard loads without network overload
- [x] Profile queries fail gracefully with defaults
- [x] Auth state changes don't trigger repeated logs
- [x] Rate limits are respected with backoff
- [x] UI remains responsive under load

## ðŸš€ Best Practices Implemented

1. **Fire-and-Forget Logging**: Security events don't block UI
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed queries use safe defaults
3. **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate calls
4. **Exponential Backoff**: Respects rate limits
5. **Silent Failures**: Non-critical operations fail quietly
6. **Resource Cleanup**: Old events auto-delete

The dashboard is now stable, performant, and handles errors gracefully without impacting user experience!
