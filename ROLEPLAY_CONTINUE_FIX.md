# RolePlay "Continue Practicing" Button Fix

## 🔍 Issue
The "Continue Practicing" button in the roleplay feedback modal was not functional - clicking it did nothing.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Updated EnhancedFeedbackDisplay Component**
- Added `onContinue` prop to handle continue functionality
- Button now has proper onClick handler that calls `onContinue` if provided, otherwise falls back to `onClose`

```typescript
interface EnhancedFeedbackDisplayProps {
  // ... existing props
  onContinue?: () => void;
}

// Button implementation
<Button 
  onClick={() => {
    if (onContinue) {
      onContinue();
    } else {
      onClose();
    }
  }}
>
  Continue Practicing
</Button>
```

### 2. **Added Continue Functionality in ConversationInterface**
- Created `generateNewObjection` function that cycles through different objection types
- Implemented `handleContinuePracticing` function that:
  - Closes the feedback display
  - Resets the conversation state
  - Generates a new objection (rotating through different types)
  - Starts a fresh practice session
  - Plays the new objection via text-to-speech if voice is enabled

```typescript
const handleContinuePracticing = async () => {
  // Reset state
  setShowEnhancedFeedback(false);
  setMessages([]);
  setInputText('');
  setEnhancedFeedback(null);
  
  // Generate new objection
  const newObjection = generateNewObjection();
  
  // Start new session
  setMessages([objectionMessage]);
  
  // Play voice if enabled
  if (mode === 'voice' || mode === 'hybrid') {
    speakText(newObjection);
  }
  
  toast({
    title: "New Objection Ready",
    description: "Continue practicing with a fresh scenario!",
  });
};
```

### 3. **Objection Rotation Logic**
The system now cycles through different objection types for variety:
- Price → Timing → Trust → Authority → Competition → Need → (back to Price)

This ensures users practice handling different types of objections in sequence.

## 🚀 Features Added

1. **Seamless Continuation**: Users can now continue practicing without returning to setup
2. **Objection Variety**: Each "Continue" generates a different type of objection
3. **State Reset**: Clean slate for each new practice round
4. **Voice Support**: New objections are spoken if voice mode is enabled
5. **User Feedback**: Toast notification confirms the new session is ready

## 📊 User Experience Improvements

- **Before**: Button was non-functional, users had to manually restart
- **After**: One-click continuation with automatic objection rotation
- **Benefit**: Smoother practice flow and more varied training scenarios

The "Continue Practicing" button now provides a seamless way to practice multiple objection scenarios in succession!
